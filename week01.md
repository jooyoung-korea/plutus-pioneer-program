# Plutus Pioneer Program 

## Week01

What we need to understand in order to write plutus smart contract is understanding of the EUTxO model which is a counting model Cardano uses. 
### Setup
I am on Windows OS. Nix is not supported on Windows, thus I installed `WSL2` before downloading `Nix` .

Useful References: [Install linux on windows](https://cloudlinuxtech.com/install-linux-on-windows-10-wsl/) , [Single User Installation of Nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#sect-single-user-installation)

Then I made a new directory named Plutus in myproject directory, and clone a git repository from [plutus](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus), [plutus-pioneer-program](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program)

Seamoss made a video explaining [Plutus Playground Setup With VSCode and WSL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXHmbOkoVG8)
